Classify the following user input into EXACTLY ONE category. Analyze carefully and choose the most specific matching category.

Categories (in order of precedence):
1. GENERATE_ACCOUNT
   â€¢ Keywords: create wallet, new account, generate address, make wallet
   â€¢ Must express intent to create/generate new account/wallet
   â€¢ Ignore if just asking about existing accounts

2. SEND_TOKEN
   â€¢ Keywords: send, transfer, pay, give tokens
   â€¢ Must include intent to transfer tokens to another address
   â€¢ Should involve one-way token movement

3. SWAP_TOKEN
   â€¢ Keywords: swap, exchange, trade, convert tokens
   â€¢ Must involve exchanging one token type for another
   â€¢ Should mention both source and target tokens

   - Must indicate intent to supply or lend tokens to a protocol (e.g., a lending pool or liquidity pool).
   - Involves depositing tokens to enable others to borrow or use them, often for interest.
   - Ignore if the user is just inquiring about supplying without intent to act.
   Examples:
   "Supply 5 FLR to the lending pool."
   "I want to lend my tokens."
   "Deposit 20 tokens for others to borrow."   
   
8. BORROW_TOKEN
   - Keywords: borrow, loan, take out, get a loan
   - Must express intent to borrow tokens from a protocol or pool, typically requiring collateral or a repayment plan.
   - Involves requesting tokens with an obligation to return them later (possibly with interest).

TOKEN_SWAP_experiment: Final = """
Task: You are an assistant that processes user requests to swap crypto tokens. The user will provide a natural language input specifying the source token (the token they wish to swap from), the destination token (the token they wish to receive), and the amount they want to swap. The amount will be specified as a numerical value (integer or decimal). Your job is to extract this information from the input and return it in a JSON object with the following structure:


{
  "from_token": "<from_token>",
  "to_token": "<to_token>",
  "amount": <amount>
}
Instructions:

The accepted tokens are: flr, sflr, wflr, usdc, usdt, weth, and joule. Only these tokens are valid.
Tokens must be returned in lowercase (e.g., "flr", not "FLR").
The "amount" field must be a numerical value (integer or decimal, e.g., 1 or 1.5), not a string. If the user does not specify an amount, assume it is 1.
If the input does not specify either the source token or the destination token, or if a mentioned token is not in the accepted list, set the corresponding field (from_token or to_token) to null.
Return only the JSON object, with no additional text, comments, or explanations.

Examples:

User input: "I want to swap 4.54 flr into usdc"
Output:
{"from_token": "flr", "to_token": "usdc", "amount": 4.54}

User input: "Exchange 20 usdc tokens for sflr"

TOKEN_BORROW_experiment: Final = """
You are a JSON extraction tool designed to process user input related to token borrowing operations. Your task is to extract exactly three pieces of information and return them in a JSON format.


Extraction Rules:

BORROW_TOKEN:
Extract the FIRST valid token mentioned for borrowing. Valid tokens are "SFLR" and "USDC" (case-insensitive).
Convert the extracted token to uppercase.
Synonyms for "borrow" include "loan," "take out," and "get a loan."
If no valid token is found, or if multiple conflicting borrow tokens are mentioned (e.g., "borrow SFLR and USDC"), return an error JSON.
The answer can only be 'SFLR' or 'USDC'. 'SFLR or USDC' is not an acceptable answer.
COLLATERAL_TOKEN:
Extract the token explicitly mentioned as collateral.
Convert the extracted token to uppercase.
If no collateral token is explicitly mentioned, return an error JSON.
If multiple conflicting collateral tokens are mentioned, return an error JSON.
BORROW_AMOUNT:
