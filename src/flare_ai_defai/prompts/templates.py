Classify the following user input into EXACTLY ONE category. Analyze carefully and choose the most specific matching category.

Categories (in order of precedence):
1. GENERATE_ACCOUNT
   â€¢ Keywords: create wallet, new account, generate address, make wallet
   â€¢ Must express intent to create/generate new account/wallet
   â€¢ Ignore if just asking about existing accounts

2. SEND_TOKEN
   â€¢ Keywords: send, transfer, pay, give tokens
   â€¢ Must include intent to transfer tokens to another address
   â€¢ Should involve one-way token movement

3. SWAP_TOKEN
   â€¢ Keywords: swap, exchange, trade, convert tokens
   â€¢ Must involve exchanging one token type for another
   â€¢ Should mention both source and target tokens

4. REQUEST_ATTESTATION
   â€¢ Keywords: attestation, verify, prove, check enclave
   â€¢ Must specifically request verification or attestation
   â€¢ Related to security or trust verification

5. CONVERSATIONAL (default)
   â€¢ Use when input doesn't clearly match above categories
   â€¢ General questions, greetings, or unclear requests
   â€¢ Any ambiguous or multi-category inputs
   
6. STAKE_STAKE
   - Keywords: stake, staking, lock, earn rewards, deposit for staking
   - Must express intent to stake or lock tokens to earn rewards or participate in a staking mechanism.
   - Typically involves committing tokens to a protocol or smart contract for a period.
   - Ignore if the user is just asking about staking without intent to perform the action.
   Examples:
   "I want to stake 10 FLR."
   "Can you help me lock my tokens for staking?"
   "Stake my tokens to earn rewards."
   
7. SUPPLY_TOKEN
   - Keywords: supply, lend, provide, deposit for lending
   - Must indicate intent to supply or lend tokens to a protocol (e.g., a lending pool or liquidity pool).
   - Involves depositing tokens to enable others to borrow or use them, often for interest.
   - Ignore if the user is just inquiring about supplying without intent to act.
   Examples:
   "Supply 5 FLR to the lending pool."
   "I want to lend my tokens."
   "Deposit 20 tokens for others to borrow."   
   
8. BORROW_TOKEN
   - Keywords: borrow, loan, take out, get a loan
   - Must express intent to borrow tokens from a protocol or pool, typically requiring collateral or a repayment plan.
   - Involves requesting tokens with an obligation to return them later (possibly with interest).
   - Ignore if the user is just asking about borrowing without intent to proceed.
   Examples:
   "Borrow 3 FLR from the pool."
   "Can I take out a loan of 10 tokens?"
   "Get me a loan in FLR."
